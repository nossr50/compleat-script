This program requires GnuPG and JRE (JAVA) to run

/// INSTALLING GNUPG INSTRUCTIONS

Instructions to install GnuPG
Install this https://gnupg.org/download/index.html
Run it and create a profile or a key (theres like 2 big ass buttons to click when you start the program, it should be obvious)
All it asks is for your name and email, just enter it and then it will ask for a password, enter that too (it can be whatever)
After this is done you never need to touch GPG again so close that shit
go to cmd prompt and type this and hit enter
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG

This sets GPG up in your environment variables (so when my script tries to send HTTPS requests it knows where GPG.exe is located)


//Compiling

You need to download mtg-api java sdk and compile it with maven and link it in the build path
for SWT libraries you can just use the precompiled ones provided by eclipse
