/// INSTALLING GNUPG INSTRUCTIONS

Instructions to install GnuPG (Windows)

Install this on your system https://gnupg.org/download/index.html
1) Run GnuPG and create a paired key
2) Setup a user/email and enter a password
3) Add GnuPG to PATH

This sets GPG up in your environment variables (so when Compleat Tool tries to send HTTPS requests it knows where GPG.exe is located)
